Cooking has always been a hobby, we have always participated in cooking programs and hosting gatherings for cooking. We consider our restaurant as start-up business model, introducing unique ideas, trying to bring IT & Digital strategy into it. We started with 3 partners now we are team of 6. We have 2 great chefs with 10 years experience in Dubai. They have so great taste on their hands that we wished it's different from whole Tallinn and yes they are amazingly unique. With so many supportive and loving guests visiting us. We will continue to make them happy every-time they visit. We love to cook and meet new people and make their day great. Love to see smiling faces and wish happiness spread around Tallinn with the taste.</p>
